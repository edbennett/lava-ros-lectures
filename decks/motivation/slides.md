Script:
In this picture we see two brilliant scientists of the seventeenth century: Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. Both of these people claimed to have invented calculus, and this was a major disagreement both between the two of them, and in the wider scientific community. Of course any dispute of this nature has many causes to it, but a significant one is that in the seventeenth century there was not a culture of publishing scientific findings to be accessible and understandable to the wider community. Instead, the motivation was to secure continued income for the scientist&mdash;by publishing work difficult to understand, to impress potential patrons with their intelligence, and so that patrons would need to hire the scientists to explain their findings in more detail.

Script:
This culture was in the process of changing, however. The Royal Society was founded to increase the common body of scientific knowledge. To this end, it founded the world's first scientific journal, and with it the process of peer review.

Process $\rightarrow$ Data $\rightarrow$ Analysis $\rightarrow$ Results

Script:
The academic journal paper presents four important aspects of a piece of work. First, the author defines the process they follow to obtain data. Then the data obtained from this process are presented. The analysis performed on these data is detailed, and the corresponding results are shown (along with any conclusions drawn from them). Anyone with the resources could repeat the process, and follow the same steps to ensure that they obtain compatible results. Even if one didn't have resources to repeat the procedure, they could still take the data and ensure that the analysis steps led to the presented results. This approach is consistent with the Royal Society's motto: _Nullius in verba_&mdash;"take nobody's word for it".

Script:
The development of computers in the twentieth century and their introduction into research changed a lot of things. Computers made it much more practical to process larger volumes of data than were previously used, so they rapidly became essential research tools in many fields. Now, since computers are designed to perform tasks deterministically, you might think that this would lead to a boost in reproducibility, as the exact sequence of instructions used to process the data could be shared, and anyone else could repeat them on their own machine.

Script:
However, the amount of code required to perform a typical analysis rapidly grew, and an academic paper is not a good place for long program listings. Unambiguously describing in words what a program does would require even more space than the program listing, so that isn't an alternative. On top of this, many analyses relied on commercial software that researchers did not have permission to share.

Process $\rightarrow$ â¬› $\rightarrow$ ðŸª„ $\rightarrow$ âœ¨Resultsâœ¨

Script:
So instead, what happened was that computers became treated like black boxes in research papers. Despite having deterministic tools designed to reliably and repeatedly perform a specified computation, reproducibility dropped, as more and more analysis was done by software that never left the researcher's or research collaboration's computers.

Script:
While this was going on, the number of journal articles being published was growing exponentially. In some disciplines, by the time a paper had been through the review process, been published in a journal, and made it into a university library to be able to be read, then the field has already moved on.

Script:
There has for a long time been a practice of sending a final draft, or "pre-print" version of your paper for trusted colleagues to read and offer feedback on before submitting for peer review. Around 1990, Joanne Cohn started a mailing list to circulate physics preprints more widely, so the whole field could benefit from earlier access to each others' results. Then in 1991, Paul Ginsparg, who we see here, turned this into a centralised mailbox, and in 1993 also introduced a web-based version, which would become known as the arXiv. This allowed researchers to share their outputs rapidly, and free of any subscription charges. With very few exceptions, almost all papers written in lattice field theory have preprints submitted to the arXiv before they are published in a peer-reviewed journal. Many researchers make a point of checking for the latest papers on the arXiv every morning before doing any other work, and for most it is the primary way they read papers, in preference to the "version of record" in a journal.

Script:
Now, while this has been going on, academic journals have also been moving online. The increasing number of publications means that it has become increasingly impractical for every article to appear in a bound, printed journal in a university library. However, as the number of papers has increased, so has the cost of subscribing to the journals to access them. Since funders do not have infinite money with which to pay journal subscriptions, universities have to be more selective about which journals they subscribe to.
